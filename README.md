# Tank Wars Code Challenge

The goal of the Tank wars challenge is build a Tank Operator BOT that cna play the Tank Wars Game - and win glory for your team!

For the Tank wars code challenge, you will have to implement the "my_tank_operator.py" file.
- Implement the "get_tank_action" function: A function that is called in real time with the current game state - and returns the actions your tank bot will take. You will have to implement logic that continuously evaluates the other tanks positions etc. and shots being fired, and decide what to do.
- Implement the "get_operator_name" function: give your operator bot a name.

You can play Tank Wars in two ways:
- Locally, to test your tank operator bot as you develop it, or against others (or human players) for fun.
- On the game server - where the finals will take place.

To start the game locally:
- Run "python tankwars_game_server.py".
- Optionally change server settings (such as which bots to play against in "server_settings.py").

## Enjoy!
